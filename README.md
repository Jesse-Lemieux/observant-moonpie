# Observant-moonpie

## Description

Observant-moonpie is a node app designed to route all CRUD functions for a social media website.


My motivation for this project was to find ways to easily execute all CRUD functions using express and mongoose with mongoDB for a social media website.
In this project some of the problems I solved were:
- Using modular code to set up routes through many directories
- Use insomnia to test routes
- Use mongoose syntax to execute CRUD functions


## Installation

This being a node.js app, you must first make sure your terminal can run this app by aquiring the needed
packages. You will need npm installed, you can read more about that [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm). You will also need Mongoose installed
which you can find [here](https://mongoosejs.com/). You will then need express found [here](https://expressjs.com/). Once those dependencies are fitted, you're ready to begin usage.

## Usage

To begin, open your terminal within the root directory, or if you're using VS code, open an integrated terminal.
You then type "npm start" on the command line to begin.
